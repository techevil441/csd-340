    <p class="intro">Hi there! My name is Michael Tracy, and I'm probably the oldest
         student you have. I'm in my 50s! I'm no stranger to HTML, but
          I must admit, it has been a long time. </p>
    <p><span class"sentence">I am currently working on my second degree.</span> My first degree is
         in Electronic Engineering. I think the two will compliment 
         each other nicely. It is strange to be back in school again!</p>
    <p>As you can see by my book choice, I do love the paranormal and 
        generally scary stuff. I even founded the local Paranormal 
        Society here! Its called the Livingston Paranormal Society, 
        named after the county. We've been a non-profit organization 
        since 2008. Yep, I'm one of THOSE guys.</p>
    <p> I also consider myself a "maker". I love to make new projects 
        and ideas. I've built 2 3d printers using Arduino boards, and 
        a CNC machine now. The CNC machine works fine, but i havent 
        figured out how to use it well yet!</p>
