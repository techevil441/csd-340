    <h2>Mac Slade - Private Detective by John Blumenthal</h2>
    
    <p class="intro">Marlowe lay on the street, his body <span id = "riddled">_______</span> with 
      bullets. I never liked riddles, and now I knew why. Thats when I saw her, standing 
      under the streetlight. This dame had gams that started at her hips, and went 
      all the way down to the ground. </p>
    <p><span class"sentence">The Nifk Dame smiled and took a couple of 
      steps toward me, stepping over poor dead Marlowe to get there. She 
      had guts, this dame. So did Marlowe, but his were all over the <span id ="floor">_____</span>. 
      She was one hot potato. </p>
    <p>"Word is youre lookin for someone Mac", she cooed, still smiling. 
      Shes tough to figure out, How does everyone in this place know my damn name? 
    "Have you ever seen a john named <span id = "Link">____</span>?" I told her as i looked her in the eye, 
    the right one to be exact. </p>
    <p>"I know a Fred named Jill Murray named Biff, but I dont think ive ever seen a John named link. 
      Say Mac, You think youre pretty tough, doncha?" She said, ogling my Physique. "I get around on 
      my <span id ="fists">_____</span> allright."I replied, trying not to notice how the streetlight 
      behind her made her look. "That sounds like a pretty clumsy way to get around", she said, 
      and that was the last thing i remembered till i woke up in a dark room.</p>
